Included in this repository are a few cool projects that I have completed for school.

P1_ search : 

A project implementing several search algorithms for a pacman agent. The algorithms allowed pacman to navigate the board. 

Algorithms implemented in search.py:
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Uniform Cost Search 
- A Star Search 

To run search algorithms run these commands from the root of the project
(Close the window of the pacman game to terminate the search) 

DFS - python3 pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent
BFS - python3 pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
UCS - python3 pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent
A*Search - python3 pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic


P2_search:

Implemented adversarial search concepts, reflex agent, minimax and alpha-beta pruning in the pacman world. 

To run search algorithms run these commands from the root of the project
(Close the window of the pacman game to terminate the search) 

Reflex agent - python3 autograder.py -q q1
Minimax - python3 autograder.py -q q2
Alpha Beta Pruning - python3 pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic
